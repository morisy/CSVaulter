# CSVaulter: Dynamic, randomzied content synergy on a static-site budget

Ever wish you could run a dynamic, fast-moving media startup without any effort or budget? You can, with the power of **CSVaulter**, which will randomly update your static site page by replacing content based on the information in a CSV (comma seperated value, i.e., spreadsheet). Every time a visitor refreshes the page, they're giving a randomly selected experience, making it feel like your destination has its finger on the pulse of what's hot and always offering something new. Since there's no server required, you can even host your new media empire for free on GitHub Pages.
